=item B<-s, --signal SIG>

Send signal SIG to the process launched by the selected jobs.

=item B<-b, --besteffort>

Change jobs to besteffort (or remove them if they are already besteffort)

=item B<--array> 

Handle array job ids, and their sub-jobs.

=item B<--sql>

Select jobs using a SQL WHERE clause on table jobs (e.g. "project = 'p1'")

=item B<--force-terminate-finishing-job>

Force jobs stuck in the Finishing state to switch to Terminated (Warning: only use as a last resort)
