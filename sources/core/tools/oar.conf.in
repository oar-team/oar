# command installed on the system (mind checking it is up-to-date, as OpenSSH 
# development is very active), which can be found in the ssh.c file of the 
# OpenSSH sources. For instance, the following command extracts the option
# string of OpenSSH 7.2p2 :

# $ cd path/to/openssh/sources/ 
# $ grep getopt -A1 ssh.c | sed 's/.*"\(.\+\)".*/\1/' | xargs | sed 's/ //g'

# The following variable forces OpenSSH configuration options for the ssh call
