How can I submit a moldable job?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You just have to use sevaral "-l" oarsub_ option(one for each moldable
description). By default the OAR scheduler will launch the moldable job which
will end first.

So you can see some free resources but the scheduler can decide to start your
job later because they will have more free resources and the job walltime will
be smaller.

How can I submit a job with a non uniform description?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example:
::
    
    oarsub -I -l /switch=1+/node=1

This example asks OAR to reserve all resources from a switch **and** a node on
another switch.

You can see the "+" syntax as a sub-reservation directive.

Can I perform a fix scheduled reservation and then launch several jobs in it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. You have to use the OAR scheduler "timesharing" feature.
To use it, the reservation and your further jobs must be of the type
timesharing (only for you).

Example:

  1. Make your reservation:
     ::
        
        oarsub -r "2006-09-12 8:00:00" -l /switch=1 -t 'timesharing=user,*'

     This command asks all resources from one switch at the given date for the
     default walltime. It alsa specifies that this job can be shared with
     himself and without a constraint on the job name.

  2. Once your reservation has begun then you can launch:
     ::

        oarsub -I -l /node=2,walltime=0:50:00 -p 'switch = "nom_du_switch_schedule"'\
        -t 'timesharing=user,*'

     So this job will be scheduled on nodes assigned from the previous reservation.

The "timesharing" oarsub_ job type option is of the form:

  - *timesharing=\*,\** : This is the default form if nothing is specified else
    *timesharing*. It indicates that the job can be shared with all users and
    every job names.
  
  - *timesharing=user,\** : This indicates that the job can be shared only with
    the same user and every job names.

  - *timesharing=\*,job_name\** : This indicates that the job can be shared
    with all users but only one with the same name.

  - *timesharing=user,job_name* : This indicates that the job can be shared only with
    the same user and one with the same job name.

How can a checkpointable job be resubmitted automatically?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have to specify that your job is *idempotent*. So, after a successfull
checkpoint, if the job is resubmitted then all will go right and there will have
no problem (like file creation, deletion, ...).

Example:
::
    
    oarsub -k 600 --signal 2 -t idempotent /path/to/prog

So this job will send a signal *SIGINT* (see *man kill* to know signal
numbers) 10 minutes before the walltime ends. Then if everything goes
well it will be resubmitted.

How to submit a non disturbing job for other users?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the *besteffort* job type. Thus your job will be launch only
if there is a hole and will be deleted if another job wants its resources.

Example:
::

    oarsub -t besteffort /path/to/prog
