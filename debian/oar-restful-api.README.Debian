OAR restfull API requires a mean of running fastcgi scripts, as the OAR user.
Apache2 fastcgi and suexec modules can be used, but implies some constraints on the apache configuration, suggesting to setup a dedicated virtual host on port 6668.
See the oar-restful-api apache configuration file for more details.

If you are not pleased with that virtual host setup, you can consider the following other options:
- Install the oar-restful-api package on a dedicated host (e.g. not on the same host as the oar-web-status package).
- Adapt the shipped Apache configuration to setup the OAR API in a hostname based virtual host.
- Adapt other CGI scripts to suexec (scripts and their parent directories must be owned and must be run by the oar user)

In any case, some more configuration is needed to get oar-restful-api with fastcgi and suexec working on Debian:

0/ Install the required packages
Package libapache2-mod-fastcgi can be installed from non-free. As of writing this, it is only available for the i386 and amd64 architectures.
Package apache2-suexec-custom must be installed in order to be able to change the suexec execution directory.

1/ Configure the apache2-suexec-custom package

Change the first line of the /etc/apache2/suexec/www-data file to "/usr/lib/cgi-bin/oarapi".

2/ Configure Apache fastcgi module to use the suexec wrapper

In the /etc/apache2/mods-available/fastcgi.conf file, uncomment the line: "FastCgiWrapper /usr/lib/apache2/suexec"

3/ Enable fastcgi and suexec Apache modules

# a2enmod fastcgi
# a2enmod suexec

4/ Grant access to the API from more hosts

By default, the OAR API can only be accessed from localhost. Look at the /etc/oar/apache/oar-restful-api.conf configuration file to allow connections from other hosts.

5/ Enable the oar-restful-api configuration and restart Apache

# a2enconf oar-restful-api
# systemctl restart apache2

You should be all set !
